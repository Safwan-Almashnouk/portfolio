                        We were presented with around 20 games, each accompanied by a 10-second clip, and tasked with selecting which vertical slice to create. As a passionate Soulsborne fan, I immediately gravitated toward the Elden Ring option and made my choice.

                    Being the only one with 350+ hours on Elden Ring, I led the team and managed the game feel. I took screenshots of the section the artists had to remake, recorded some videos walking around, and captured all the attack animations. After that, I began working on the combo system.

                On the surface, the combat seemed rather simple, but in reality, it was a bit more complex. For starters, each button press — "E" for a light attack and "Q" for a heavy attack — triggers an animation. If the button is pressed again during the last half of the animation, the press is registered for a follow-up attack. This process continues through the second animation, but the third attack no longer registers additional presses.

                The first setback I faced wjem creating the combat system was that each frame with the sword in the enemy would damage it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What I decided to do was create a list in the sword which would add the hitbox of an enemy into a list, after that, every frame of the collision, it would check if that hitbox was in the list. If it were, it would ignore it. At the end of the attack animation, the list is then cleared.

                Being lead developer was certinally fun, and I enjoyed it plenty. There are some things that I should have done diffrent, such as following strict code coventions and ensuring that my code remains clean, dry, and srp. It was something I did not try my hardest to do here, and I do regret that.
