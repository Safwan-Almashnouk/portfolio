            <p>My name is Safwan Almashnouk. I am a 20-year-old game developer living in Haarlem, in the Netherlands. I have been living here since 2017.
               <p> I can confidently call myself a game developer since 2021, when I started my journey at Media College Amsterdam, where I found my passion after searching for so long. 
                My future plans are to get an HBO diploma in game design at the HKU, as my dream is to become a respected Game Designer and, one day, a director.

            <H1>Why is this my passion?</H1>
        </div>
        <div class="InfoInnerd">
            <p>Ever since I was young, I always loved video games more than playing outside. I always felt so immersed and in wonder when playing on my PSP.
                I remember how I used to always wonder how games were made and how I loved taking apart different objects at home out of curiosity. 
               <p> I love game development and design because I love puzzles, I love testing my problem-solving skills, I love creating, and I love sharing ideas and concepts.
                I want to give people the same feeling I got from playing my favorite games, and I want to one day share all these stories in my head through a game, as I believe games are the most expressive artistic method to communicate ideas and concepts.

            <p>I am known as the guy who always tries to learn something new. I always—*and I mean always*—am open to learning new things, to expand my skill set and broaden my view.
                I have been a lead developer as well as the designer in multiple projects that I have worked on. I've also been called laid back, but can get serious when needed, and I’m right in the middle between introverts and extroverts.
                <p>My best social skill, according to my first internship manager, was the fact that I focus on my work and do not let others distract me. And while my team was rather loud, I remained quiet and brought the noise level in the office down, keeping it manageable. 
                When I have something that needs to be done, I sit and work my hardest until it is finished.

            <p>Being a game developer and future designer, it is no surprise that I play a lot of games. The genre that I love the most has always been Action RPGs. I love creating my own character and having long adventures.
                Some of my favorite games have been: Bloodborne, Dark Souls 1 to 3, Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, and Home Safety Hotline, as well as Persona 5. I also enjoy racing games; however, I can confidently say that I do not enjoy multiplayer games that much.
            <p>
                 I also play DnD and run my own campaign, which two of my games have taken inspiration from (Forsaken Kingdom and Witch&Knight).
                I am an animal person—I have 4 cats and a bunch of fish—and in my free time, I am trying to get better at digital art.
